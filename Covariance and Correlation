# Covariance

We are going to carry out a study in which we will analyze the impact of drinking soft drinks, in particular Cola, and weight gain.
The study will be carried out on 7 people who will have a different consumption of cans during the period of time.
Participants will have to weigh themselves again to assess the impact of soft drinks, in particular Cola, on their weight gain.

#Create Variables

weight_gain = [10, 12, 14, 16, 18, 20, 24]
Cola_consumption = [30, 35, 40, 45, 50, 55, 65]

x = weight_gain
y = Cola_consumption

#Create DF

cv =pd.DataFrame ({"weight_gain" : x,
      "Cola_consumption" : y})
      
#Covariance :

sns.scatterplot(x=weight_gain, y=Cola_consumption, data= cv)

cv.cov()

#Correlation 

cv.corr()

sns.heatmap(cv)
